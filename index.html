		Hi! I'm Harry, an aspiring professional surveyor currently in my fourth year at RMIT, pursuing a Bachelor of Applied Science (Surveying) (Honours). Over the past four years, I’ve gained valuable hands-on experience working as a surveyor alongside my studies. I'm particularly excited about utilising the Robotic Optical Observatory (ROO) for my final year project, which you can see pictured below. Outside of work, I enjoy hiking, scuba diving, and practicing jiu-jitsu!
		</p>
		<p>
			This geoportfolio showcases my academic achievements, industry experience, and the skills I’ve developed throughout my journey.

	<div class="paragraphs"> <!-- #ID# #AP TEXT# -->
		Cadastral surveying involves determining and legally documenting land boundaries and property ownership. Survey plans serve as official records, showing precise measurements that future surveyors can rely on. When a lot of land is subdivided, a 'plan of subdivision' is created. 
Worksheets are detailed working documents used by surveyors, both in the field and the office, to record raw data, perform calculations, and map out how the title boundary aligns with the property’s fencing. 
Below is an example of a mock plan of subdivision I developed using CAD software. Below there is also a hand-drawn worksheet I completed, where I applied Crown land surveying principles to divide the area.

	<div class="paragraphs"> <!-- #ID# #AP TEXT# -->
		My honours project focuses on enhancing the accuracy of the coordinates for the Robotic Optical Observatory (ROO), located atop the 11-storey Building 201 at RMIT. 
		Previous research has explored factors such as the building’s movement and the camera timing delay between the telescope and the computer system. My objective is to 
		determine whether refining the coordinates of the ROO will improve its astrometric precision. To achieve this, I plan to conduct a local tie-survey at RMIT’s Bundoora 
		West Campus, followed by an Invariant-Point (IVP) determination, using methodologies employed by Geoscience Australia for their Satellite Laser Ranging (SLR) telescopes.
		I created a poster about my project for a presentation. It outlines my project aim, the supporting literature and the method I will be following. Check it out below!

		been fortunate to volunteer as a Geospatial Analyst for the Geospatial Council of Australia. The below details will outline my experience in these companies and the 
		skills I have developed. Through these roles, I have gained hands-on experience in both technical surveying techniques and geospatial data analysis, allowing me to

		During my first year at RMIT, I was fortunate to secure a position with JCA Land Consultants, which has greatly complemented my studies, particularly in 
		cadastral-specific subjects. The job provided me with the opportunity to apply industry knowledge to my university coursework and vice-versa. I began as 
		a survey assistant, primarily responsible for equipment operation and recording field notes. I became proficient with Leica products and Captivate software, 
		including the Leica TS16 and TS15 Total Stations, GS18 rover, CS30 tablet, CS20 controller, and BLK360 laser scanner.
		<p>
			After two years in this role, I transitioned to party leader, a position I have held since. My responsibilities include conducting document research, 
			leading field crews for residential and engineering surveys, operating Leica equipment, processing and analyzing survey data, and using software such as 
			LisCAD NEO and AutoCAD. I also assist in training staff and oversee the maintenance of equipment and office records. I have thoroughly enjoyed my time at 
			JCA and remain committed to advancing my career with the goal of becoming a licensed surveyor.

		I volunteered for the FireWater Map-a-thon, where I contributed to collecting data on static water infrastructure, including dams, water tanks, and swimming pools, 
		to support bushfire preparedness for the upcoming season. We utilized the OpenStreetMap (OSM) platform and HOT Tasking Manager to coordinate this effort. 
		The initiative was launched in response to the devastating national bushfires of late 2019-2020. The Surveying & Spatial Science Institute (SSSI), now the 
		Geospatial Council of Australia, organised a nationwide volunteer network to map damaged infrastructure. In early February 2020, the SSSI National Bushfire 
		Recovery Map-a-thon attracted over 600 volunteers from more than 25 countries, becoming one of the largest map-a-thon events in the Australasian region. 
		Collectively, 2,793,879 hectares were mapped, with 15,731 edits, 13,891 building edits, and 1,091 damaged features identified, including 945 damaged buildings. 
		The data collected provided critical guidance for recovery efforts, supplementing existing authoritative sources where data was lacking.
